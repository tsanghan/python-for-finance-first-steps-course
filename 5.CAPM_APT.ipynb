    "Correlation coefficient tells us the extent to which variables are related. `Correlation matrix` is a tool to calculate and visualize the correlation coefficients among the variables of interest. The most striking observation is the correlation coefficient of 76% between Comcast and S&P-500 indicating that there is a high correlation between these two variables. However, it is not the case for AT&T and Verizon whose correlation coefficients with S&P-500 are -52% and 55%, respectively."

    "Now, after having the return for three stock and one market index, extracting risk free rate allows us to compute excess return. To access the risk free rate data, we use `Fred API` as we have learned previosly. Please note that there is no single risk free rate, different researchers apply different risk free rate but the common property of these rates is that they are issued by a government, which makes them safe heaven to invest. Here, we select `3-Month Treasury Constant Maturity Rate`, which is short-term T-Bill with relatively low and safe return."

This estimated beta coefficient is statistically significant at 1% level since we have a t-value of 15.164 (or p-value of 0.0000). However, the intercept term is not statistically significant.

    "The story here a bit different. `Inflation rate` has a p-value of 0.099 meaning that it is statistically significant at 10% level. In addition to that, we have another variable with p-value of 0.000, which is `excess_return_GSPC`. Thus, both inflation rate and excess_return_GSPC have explanatory power on excess returns of Verizon, which is our dependent variable in this case. To be more precise, the magnitude of inflation rate, -6.9187 , is negative implying that an increase in inflation rate results in a decrease in excess returns of Verizon by nearly 6.91. On the contrary, a raise in excess return of market index leads to an increase in excess returns of Verizon by approximately 0.94."

The CAPM tells us the stock characteristics based on the market index and it is a vital sign in the investor's decision making process. APT, on the other hand, tries to unveil the stock return dynamic based on some macroeconomic factors so that we are able to identify which factor affects the stock return dynamic most."
